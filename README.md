# Simple WebSocket Server

This is a simple WebSocket server with Node.js.
It emits random values periodically and is useful for WebSocket testing purposes.

It makes use of both [native WebSockets](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/) and the [socket.io library](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/) â€“ each on different ports.

## Start server

Clone the repo and run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
